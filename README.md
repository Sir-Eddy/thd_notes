# THD Notes

Welcome to my personal notes repository for my Cyber Security B. Sc. study program. Here, I document key concepts, learnings, and resources from my studies to help organize and consolidate knowledge. 

## Access Information

The notes are stored as `.onepkg` files in a OneDrive folder for convenient access and updates:

**DARK MODE SHOULD BE ENABLED! (Look below)**

[1. Semester](https://1drv.ms/o/c/b97b5fa10d3921cd/Eg-W69I0dCdAuOqOoy7aZxgBFo49WykjPEhxJh8zSCyyvA?e=Va4A0g)

[2. Semester](https://1drv.ms/o/c/b97b5fa10d3921cd/Emb_Zj_qncxMh4jhL80b0joBnxds55Sv1eut4YLyn6D-BQ?e=4A0AO5)

## Activate Dark Mode

My notebooks are created with dark mode enabled. If accessed in light mode, black handwriting is inverted to white. This causes an issue with exported PDFs, as white text appears on a white background, making it invisible. Unfortunately, OneNote Web does not support dark mode. As a workaround, I recommend installing a dark mode browser extension, such as [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/), to ensure better visibility.
